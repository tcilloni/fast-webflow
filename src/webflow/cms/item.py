class Item(Entity):
    """
    An Item object connects with WebFlow's CMS API.

    Upon initialization, the object behaves like a dictionary, where its keys are the fields
    returned by the API's `get` method on the collection. The object allows getting, deleting, and 
    updating the relative item.
    
    You must supply the collection ID as well as the item ID in order to uniquely find the item.

    Attributes:
        id (str): ID field (often `_id`) of the item in the CMS.
        delay (float): number of seconds to wait after a request hits the rate limit.
        max_retries (int): number of times failed requests are retried (including after hitting rate limits).
        data (dict): dictionary representation of the item's data.
